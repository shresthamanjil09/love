        <h2>Happy one month of our relationship.</h2>
        <h4>My darling,
            <br>
            You are the sunshine of my life, the reason for my smile, and the beat of my heart. I miss you so much.
            You are always in my thoughts and in my dreams. Every time I hear your voice, I feel a surge of joy and love. Every time I see your face, I feel a wave of warmth and happiness. You are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, and I can't wait to hold you in my arms again.
            You are my soulmate, my best friend, and my lover. You support me, encourage me, and inspire me. You make me a better person every day. You are everything I ever wanted and more.
            You are my hope, my faith, and my light. You are my treasure, my precious, and my heart. You are my everything, and I am yours. I love you with all my being, and I always will.
